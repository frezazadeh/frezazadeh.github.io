<span style="font-size: 22px;">Innovations</span>
======
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**Adaptive Standardized Protocol Learning**, An adaptive standardized protocol for addressing inter-slice resource contention and conflict in 6G network slicing. [[Access Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07362)]</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**Explanation-Guided AI (In-hoc Explainability)**, The core concept behind the proposed approach is the intrinsic interpretability of the reward hypothesis in Deep Reinforcement Learning. [[Access Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283684)]</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**SliceOps**, The proposed approach aligns with this philosophy of segregating the control plane from the user plane in 5G/6G by creating an innovative standalone AI plane to independently provide AI services and functions to the rest of the 6G network. [[Access Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01658)]</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**Quantum Deep Reinforcement Learning (QDRL) in 6G Slicing**, The power of quantum computing pursue a distributed computation and learning can be deemed as a promising prerequisite. [[Access Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11755)]</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**Massively Large-Scale Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**, We explore a novel approach to 6G networks by separating actors from learners and targeting latency cost under a long-term statistical service-level agreement (SLA). [[Access Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9685218)]</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**Brain-inspired Continuous Action in 5G/6G**, For solving continuous tasks, this approach adopts and fine-tune an alternative way of updating the actor (policy) in DDPG algorithm to speed-up convergence and fulfill a stable and robust learning process based on TD3 algorithm.
