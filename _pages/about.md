<span style="font-size: 16px;">Farhad Rezazadeh received the Ph.D. degree (*Excellent Cum Laude*) in [Signal Theory and Communications](https://tsc.upc.edu/en) from [Technical University of Catalonia (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/ca), Barcelona, Spain under the supervision of Prof. Christos Verikoukis and with the tutoring of Prof. Luis Alonso. He is currently a Researcher (*Senior Applied AI Engineer*) in the [Services as NetworkS (SaS) Research Unit](https://www.cttc.cat/services-as-networks-sas/) at the [Telecommunications Technological Center of Catalonia (CTTC)](https://www.cttc.cat/), Barcelona, Spain. Prior to his current role, he contributed as a Research Assistant at the [Advanced Broadband Communications Center (CCABA)](https://ccaba.upc.edu/en), under the esteemed guidance of Prof. Josep Solé-Pareta. He participated in 8 European and National *5G/B5G/6G* R&D projects with leading and technical tasks in the areas of Applied *AI* and *XAI*. His [*AI innovation*](https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/52337) in B5G/6G resource allocation was recognized as a great EU-funded Innovation by the European Commission's Innovation Radar. He was awarded the first patent connected to the H2020 5G-SOLUTIONS project. He was a secondee at [NEC Lab Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/6g-networks) under the supervision of Prof. Xavier Costa-Pérez and had scientific missions at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lkn/home/), [Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH-School)](https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/en/startpage), and [Universitat de Girona (UdG)](https://bcds.udg.edu/news). He is a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Ph.D.](https://www.5gstepfwd.eu/#home) grantee and won 5 different *IEEE/IEEE ComSoc* grants, 2 [European Cooperation in Science and Technology](https://www.cost.eu/) grants, and a [Catalan Government Ph.D.](https://agaur.gencat.cat/ca/inici/) grant. He is an active member of IEEE Young Professionals and IEEE Spain - Technical Activities and Standards with more than 23 top-tier journals and conferences. He has over 130 verified reviews for peer-reviewed publications. He serves as Organizing, Chair, Reviewer, and TPC member in IEEE and Guest Editor in Elsevier. He is an ACM Professional Member and coordinates the IEEE Trustworthy Internet of Things (TRUST-IoT) working group.</span>
