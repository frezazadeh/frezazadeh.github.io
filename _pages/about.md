He is an Applied AI and Generative AI professional with 10+ years of experience building and deploying
real-world AI solutions across TelecomTech, TravelTech, and BioTech. His work spans end-to-end product development—from
problem framing and model development to deployment and measurable business impact—with a focus on translating advanced AI
into reliable, scalable systems. He is currently a <em>Machine Learning Scientist</em> in the Product and Growth department at
<a href="https://www.hostelworldgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hostelworld Group</a>.
Prior to his current role, he was a <em>Visiting Associate Professor</em> at UPC and a Researcher (<em>Senior Applied AI Engineer</em>)

<a href="https://ccaba.upc.edu/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Broadband Communications Center (CCABA)</a>,
under the guidance of Prof. Josep Solé-Pareta.

He has technical and leadership experience in ten European and national R&amp;D, industrial, and business projects focusing on applied AI.
His <a href="https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/52337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI innovation</a>
in B5G/6G resource allocation was recognized by the European Commission’s Innovation Radar and resulted in two EU project patents.
His international experience includes roles at
<a href="https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/6g-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEC Lab Europe</a>
(under the supervision of Prof. Xavier Costa-Pérez) and scientific missions at
<a href="https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lkn/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a>,
<a href="https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/en/startpage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)</a>,
and <a href="https://bcds.udg.edu/news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universitat de Girona (UdG)</a>.
He was a <a href="https://www.5gstepfwd.eu/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Skłodowska-Curie Ph.D.</a> fellow and won five different IEEE/IEEE ComSoc grants,
two <a href="https://www.cost.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)</a> grants,
and a <a href="https://agaur.gencat.cat/ca/inici/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalan Government Ph.D.</a> grant.

As an active member of ACM and IEEE, he has contributed 33+ publications and three books and completed 295+ peer reviews.
He is actively serves as Speaker, Organizer, Chair, Reviewer, and TPC member in IEEE, as well as Guest Editor in Elsevier.
He is an expert in Applied XAI and Generative AI, working on pre-training, fine-tuning, aligning, and deploying large language models (LLMs) and foundation models
for applications such as code generation, drug discovery, telecom, content processing, simulation automation, time series, business recommendation systems,
and decision-making tasks. He recently introduced <em>Digital Co-Founders</em> as a conceptual paradigm that positions Agentic AI systems as autonomous partners
enabling individuals to ideate, build, and scale viable solo businesses.
